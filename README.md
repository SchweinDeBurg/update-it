# update-it

UpdateIt! is the application designed for the synchronization of the source folder's content with the content of other (target) folder on a local computer or (and) a remote FTP server. This is wizard that I wrote to fast and comfortable update of my own personal website. It searches (at request — recursively) all files in the source folder that are modified after specified date/time. It can copy found files (everyone or selected) to the target folder with preservation of an initial structure of the subfolders. This application allows to upload all files from the updated folder (with preservation of its structure) to the specified FTP server, to compress this folder in the same named zip-archive, to send one to the given E-mail.
