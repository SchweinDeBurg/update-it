class="updateItShot"><strong>UpdateIt!</strong> is the application designed for the
synchronization of the source folder's content  with the content of other (target) folder on
a local computer or (and) a remote FTP server. This is wizard that I wrote to fast and
comfortable update of my own personal website. It searches (at request &mdash; recursively)
all files in the source folder that are modified after specified date/time. It can copy found
files (everyone or selected) to the target folder with preservation of an initial structure
of the subfolders. This application allows to upload all files from the updated folder (with
preservation of its structure) to the specified FTP server, to compress this folder in the same
 named zip-archive, to send one to the given E-mail.
<br clear="left"></p>

<p class="pageText">
<img src="./images/step_1.gif" width=379 height=301 align="left" border=0
class="updateItShot"><strong>Step #1</strong> is the  selection of source and target folders.
It is required to choose a name of the  folder for searching the updated files and a name of
the  folder where these updated files will be copied or moved. Also, it is required to
specify the date and time  since which  files in the source folder are considered updated.
If <span class="winText">Include subfolders</span> option is  set , the files searching will
be carried out recursively &mdash; in the source folder and in all folders inside  it. In the
field <span class="winText">Exclude mask(s)</span> there is possibility to type one or
several masks of files (separated from each other by commas) which should be excluded from
search. To delete the content of the target folder as a preliminary one it is possible to set
<span class="winText">Cleanup this folder first</span> option (if <span class="winText">Delete
files to Recycle Bin if possible</span> option is set files will be removed to the
<span class="winText">Recycle Bin</span> on conditions that its usage is enabled by system
options). Setting <span class="winText">Compare contents of the newer and existing older
files</span> option allows to exclude from results of search those files which binary contents
do not differ from the existing copies in the target folder.
<br clear="left"></p>

<p class="pageText">
<img src="./images/step_2.gif" width=379 height=301 align="left" border=0
class="updateItShot"><strong>Step #2</strong> is reviewing the list of the updated files. On
this step you can see the list of the updated files found in the source folder. The Name, the
extension, the relative path in the source folder, and also the date and time of the last
modification are shown for each file. In order to remove file(s) from this list (and thereby
to exclude them from the further processing) it is required to mark corresponding line(s) and
to click the <span class="winText">Remove from list</span> button. Note that in this case
files leave only the list, but still stay in the source folder.
<br clear="left"></p>

<p class="pageText">
<img src="./images/step_3.gif" width=379 height=301 align="left" border=0
class="updateItShot"><strong>Step #3</strong> is actions selection. On this step it is required
to choose,  what exactly should be done with the found files. Copying or moving files to the
target folder are obligatory actions that are chosen by means of the group
<span class="winText">Action to perform</span> switches. Besides this, it is possible to upload
the target folder contents (with full structure preservation) to the specified folder on a
FTP server. For this purpose set <span class="winText">Also upload file(s) to the
FTP server</span> option and fill the fields of <span class="winText">FTP Settings</span>
group, having specified the address and the port of a server, as well as the login and the
password for the access. To compress a target folder in the same named zip-archive, set
<span class="winText">Also ZIP folder with the copied/moved file(s)</span> option. This archive
file can be sent as an attachment to the given E-mail address. For this, set
<span class="winText">Also send ZIPped folder via e-mail</span> option and fill fields of
<span class="winText">Mail Settings</span> group, having specified addresses of the sender and
the recipient, and also the SMTP-server which will be used for sending the mail. Note that this
feature is accessible only in the case when the key
<span class="winText">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Elijah Zarezky\UpdateIt!\SMTP</span> in the
system registry contains DWORD named <span class="winText">Enable</span> and its value is
different from zero.

<p class="pageText">
<img src="./images/step_4.gif" width=379 height=301 align="left" border="0"
class="updateItShot"/><strong>Step #4</strong> is processing the files. On this step it is
possible to watch the progress of copying (or moving) the updated files from the source folder
into the target folder, of uploading files from the target folder to the given FTP server,
compression of the target folder and sending  the  given archive to the E-mail address that was
specified earlier.

This edition of the <strong>UpdateIt!</strong> has the following differences from the
standard.
</p><ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Beyond standard Deflate, BZip2 compression method is supported. It compresses files more
efficiently than the Deflate algorithm, but is slower. It is supported by
<a href="http://www.7-zip.com/">7-Zip</a> since version 4.5x, by
<a href="http://www.pkware.com/software-pkzip/intro">PKZIP</a> since version 4.6 and by
<a href="http://www.winzip.com/">WinZip</a> since version 10.0. Earlier versions of these
programs will not decompress archives that use the BZip2 algorithm.</li>
<li style="margin-top: 1%;">AES encryption with key sizes 128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit is
supported for the produced archive files. The format of AES encrypted data conforms to the
<a href="http://www.winzip.com/aes_info.htm">WinZip AES Encryption Specification</a>. It is
the preferred way to ensure that your data is secure. <strong>UpdateIt!&nbsp;Pro</strong>
encrypts files the way the WinZip 11.0 does.</li>
<li style="margin-top: 1%;">If the number of the files to compress exceeds 65&nbsp;535 or
size of an archive should be greater than 4 gigabytes then Zip64 format will be automatically
used. The Zip64 format is an extension to the standard Zip format that practically removes
limits in sizes and item numbers within a zip archive.</li>
<li style="margin-top: 1%;">This application is distributed as a freeware but closed source
due to the <a href="http://www.artpol-software.com/ZipArchive/Default.aspx">ZipArchive</a>

<h1 class="subTopic">Export/import of options</h1>

<p class="pageText">
Since version 1.0.2598, in the application there is a feature of options export/import (only
under Windows 2000/XP/2003) which can be useful at re-installation of the operating system.
Corresponding commands are in the system menu of the main window. Note that the export of
options is possible at any stage of work of the application, but the import of options is
possible only on a &#8222;zero&#8220; step (on the <span class="winText">Welcome!</span> page).

<p class="pageText">
At present the use of keys of the command line does not automate the work of the application
completely, it only substitutes the specified parameters into corresponding controls. It
allows to accelerate user’s work as much as possible if typical scripts of search and
processing of the updated files are present. Each of the keys can be used independently if
it has not been stipulated in a different way (as in case of the keys 
<span class="argName">Font-FaceName</span> and <span class="argName">Font-PointSize</span>).

In any case, the keys of the command line have a priority over the corresponding options that
are kept at the system registry. For example, if the command line contains the key
<span class="argName">SourceDir-Recurce</span> that has the incorrect value of 4, and the
corresponding parameter in the system registry has the correct value of 0, the final
&#8222;result&#8220; will be 1 as the interpretation of key value from the command line.

<h1 class="subTopic">UpdateIt! On Google Code</h1>

<p class="pageText">
Since December, 2007, the UpdateIt! project, is placed on
<a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code</a> as well. Its main page is accessible at
<a href="http://update-it.googlecode.com/">http://update-it.googlecode.com</a>. It is
possible to find the latest development builds as well as the mirror of
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> repository with all revisions of
project sources there. For anonymous access to reading this mirror and receiving local copies
of all files that are required for independent building, It is necessary to perform the
following steps.
</p>

<ol style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 2pt;">
<li style="margin-top: 6pt;">Create somewhere in file system a new folder with the name
<span class="winText">GoogleCode</span> for example.</li>
<li style="margin-top: 4pt;">Launch Command Prompt, go to this folder and sequentially
execute these commands:
<pre style="margin-left: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt;
margin-top: 4pt;">svn checkout http://repositorium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ Repository
svn checkout http://update-it.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ UpdateIt</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p class="pageText">
After that, to build the project, it is enough to open the file
<span class="winText">UpdateIt.2003.sln</span> from the folder
<span class="winText">GoogleCode\UpdateIt</span> in Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003
environment, to set UpdateIt as the startup project and then to execute
<span class="winText">Build Solution</span> command. Completely automated building of the
project and its distribution kits can be executed by means of utility
<span class="winText">NAnt</span> after its assignment on an input file
<span class="winText">UpdateIt.2003.build</span> &mdash; it is necessary to go to the
<span class="winText">GoogleCode\UpdateIt</span> folder and then  to execute a corresponding
command from Visual Studio .NET 2003 Command Prompt.
